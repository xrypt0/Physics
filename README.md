# Physics
It is a repository that I opened to help understand and process a complex and enjoyable science like physics.

By going to the folder of the physics tool you want, you can both understand the use of the tool and understand the physics. __IN THIS SECTION I WILL ONLY TALK ABOUT PHYSICS!__

# What Is The Physics ?

In my own words, physics is a language we created to understand the nature. The alphabet of this language is **_mathematics_**. We will aim to thoroughly understand this science, which we have created to understand nature, within this repository and use it in a technical way.

# What We Will Do ?

We will learn software such as [ROOT](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROOT), [MCNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_N-Particle_Transport_Code), [Comsol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMSOL_Multiphysics) and evaluate simple tutorials to learn and understand how they are used in physics.
